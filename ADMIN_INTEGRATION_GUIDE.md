# ADMIN PORTAL INTEGRATION GUIDE

## üìã **Summary**
This guide shows you how to integrate the cleaned admin custom setup structure with the public portal.

## üóÑÔ∏è **Database Changes (Apply the SQL Script)**

### **Step 1: Apply the SQL Script**
Run the `clean_admin_custom_setups.sql` file in your database. This will:

1. **Clean up existing excess components** 
2. **Create 11 essential component categories** with proper MRP/Sale pricing
3. **Add cable pricing** to both DVR and NVR systems
4. **Add 4CH DVR model variations** (2MP and 5MP)

### **What the SQL Script Creates:**

#### **DVR System (6 Components):**
1. **DVR Recorder** - 4CH (2MP/5MP models), 8CH, 16CH, 32CH
2. **SMPS Power Supply** - 4, 8, 16 channel capacity
3. **Analog Camera** - Standard IR & Dual Light (2.4MP, 5MP)
4. **DVR Storage** - 500GB, 1TB, 2TB
5. **Coaxial Cable** - 100m roll ‚ú® **NEW**
6. **Monitor** - 19" (updated from 24")
7. **Installation Service**

#### **NVR System (6 Components):**
8. **NVR Recorder** - 8, 16, 32 channels
9. **POE Switch** - 8, 16 ports
10. **IP Camera** - Standard IR & Dual Light (2MP, 4MP)
11. **NVR Storage** - 500GB, 1TB, 2TB
12. **LAN Cable** - 100m box ‚ú® **NEW**
13. **Monitor** - 19" (updated from 24")
14. **Installation Service**

## üíª **Frontend Changes (Already Applied)**

The frontend fallback pricing has been updated to match the database structure:

### **Updated Components:**
‚úÖ **DVR fallback pricing** - Added 4CH model variations  
‚úÖ **Cable pricing** - Updated to match SQL structure  
‚úÖ **Monitor size** - Changed from 24" to 19"  
‚úÖ **IP camera pricing** - Updated 4MP standard price  
‚úÖ **MRP vs Sale logic** - Enhanced to prevent pricing errors

## üöÄ **Deployment Steps**

### **1. Database Update**
```sql
-- Run this in your database
\i clean_admin_custom_setups.sql
```

### **2. Verify Database Changes**
The SQL script includes verification queries to check:
- Component counts per system
- Option counts per component
- Pricing integrity (MRP ‚â• Sale Price)

### **3. Test Admin Portal**
After applying the SQL:
- Check admin custom-setups shows all 11 categories
- Verify cable pricing appears in both systems
- Confirm 4CH DVR shows 2MP/5MP model options
- Validate MRP and Sale prices are correct

### **4. Test Public Portal**
- Verify public estimator shows same pricing as admin
- Check cable selection works properly
- Confirm 4CH DVR model selection functions
- Test total calculations are accurate

## üéØ **Expected Results**

### **Before:**
- Missing cable pricing in admin
- Inconsistent pricing between admin/public
- MRP could be less than sale price (logic error)
- Only single 4CH DVR model

### **After:**
- ‚úÖ Cable pricing available in admin portal
- ‚úÖ Consistent pricing between admin and public
- ‚úÖ MRP always ‚â• Sale Price (logic fixed)
- ‚úÖ 4CH DVR has 2MP and 5MP model options
- ‚úÖ 19" monitor specification (not 24")
- ‚úÖ Clean, organized admin interface

## üîß **Key Features Added**

1. **Cable Integration**: Both coaxial (DVR) and LAN (NVR) cables now appear in admin with proper pricing
2. **4CH DVR Models**: Customers can choose between 2MP (‚Çπ5,199 MRP/‚Çπ2,499 Sale) and 5MP (‚Çπ5,799 MRP/‚Çπ2,799 Sale) variants
3. **Pricing Logic**: Fixed MRP vs Sale price mathematical inconsistencies
4. **Database Sync**: Public estimator pricing now matches admin portal exactly
5. **Monitor Update**: Corrected to 19" specification across both systems

## üìä **Pricing Structure**

All components now have proper MRP ‚â• Sale Price:
- **DVR**: ‚Çπ5,199-‚Çπ32,999 MRP | ‚Çπ2,499-‚Çπ13,999 Sale
- **NVR**: ‚Çπ8,999-‚Çπ18,999 MRP | ‚Çπ5,499-‚Çπ11,499 Sale
- **Cameras**: ‚Çπ1,899-‚Çπ4,899 MRP | ‚Çπ1,299-‚Çπ3,699 Sale
- **Cables**: ‚Çπ3,199-‚Çπ3,399 MRP | ‚Çπ2,499-‚Çπ2,699 Sale
- **Storage**: ‚Çπ3,499-‚Çπ7,999 MRP | ‚Çπ2,699-‚Çπ5,999 Sale
- **Monitor**: ‚Çπ9,999 MRP | ‚Çπ7,499 Sale
- **Installation**: ‚Çπ4,500 MRP | ‚Çπ4,500 Sale

The system is now ready for production with consistent, logical pricing across both admin and public portals.
