# ðŸŽ¯ Audit Issues and Fixes Summary

**Date:** October 11, 2025

## 1. Configuration Improvements

- Enabled React Strict Mode in `next.config.mjs` (`reactStrictMode: true`).
- Added middleware for `/management` routes to enforce authentication and redirect unauthenticated users to `/login`.
- Created custom 404 page at `src/app/not-found.tsx` for unmatched routes.
- Verified Tailwind, PostCSS, TypeScript, ESLint, and Vercel configurations are correct.

## 2. Code Quality Enhancements

- Removed all `console.log` debug statements from `ProductCard.tsx`.
- Refactored image fallback logic in `ProductCard.tsx` to use React state (`hasImageError`) instead of direct DOM manipulation (`innerHTML`).

## 3. Database Hardening

- Added unique constraint on `products.handle` to ensure URL slug uniqueness.
- Added unique constraint on `coupons.code` to prevent duplicate coupon codes.

## 4. Documentation Updates

- No temporary or fix-related markdown files remain in root.
- Updated `DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md` references if needed to reflect current documentation files.
