# 🔒 SECURITY FIX REQUIRED - Leaked Password Protection

## ⚠️ Current Status: DISABLED (WARNING)

Your Supabase Auth is currently allowing users to sign up with passwords that have been compromised in data breaches.

---

## ✅ Quick Fix (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Open Supabase Dashboard
Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT_ID

### Step 2: Navigate to Authentication
Click: **Authentication** → **Policies** (or **Settings**)

### Step 3: Enable Protection
Find: **"Password Strength"** section  
Toggle ON: **"Check against HaveIBeenPwned breach database"**

### Step 4: Save
Click: **Save** or **Update**

### Step 5: Test
Try signing up with password `password123` - should be **REJECTED** ✅

---

## 📋 What This Does

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| ❌ Users can use "password123" | ✅ Compromised passwords rejected |
| ❌ Users can use "qwerty" | ✅ Checks against 600M+ leaked passwords |
| ❌ High risk of account takeover | ✅ Forces users to use unique passwords |
| ❌ No password breach checking | ✅ Automatic HaveIBeenPwned integration |

---

## 🧪 Test Cases

### Should REJECT (Compromised):
```
password123  → ❌ Found in 3.7M breaches
123456       → ❌ Found in 23M breaches  
qwerty       → ❌ Found in 3.8M breaches
letmein      → ❌ Found in 235K breaches
```

### Should ACCEPT (Not Compromised):
```
MyStr0ng!P@ssw0rd2024  → ✅ Not in breach database
Tec8unny$ecure!Pass    → ✅ Not in breach database
```

## 📊 Impact

- **Users Protected:** All new signups and password changes
- **Performance Impact:** Minimal (< 100ms check)
- **Privacy:** Password never sent in full (only hash prefix)
- **Compliance:** Helps with GDPR, PCI DSS, SOC 2

---

## 🚨 Why This Matters

**Without Protection:**
1. User signs up with "password123"
2. Account created successfully
3. Attacker tries common passwords
4. Account compromised ❌

**With Protection:**
1. User tries to sign up with "password123"
2. Supabase checks HaveIBeenPwned
3. Password rejected
4. User forced to choose secure password ✅

## 📝 Additional Recommendations

While you're in the Authentication settings, also consider:

- [ ] Set minimum password length to 8-12 characters
- [ ] Require uppercase + lowercase + numbers + symbols
- [ ] Enable account lockout after 5 failed attempts
- [ ] Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
- [ ] Set session timeout to 24 hours or less
